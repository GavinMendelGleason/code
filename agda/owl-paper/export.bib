Pierce, is an excellent introduction of the branch of mathematics called category theory, and its application to computer science. As the title suggests, this book covers the basics of category theory, and presupposes no prior knowledge of it. The author motivates the development of category theory with examples from computer science, rather than the mathematical examples found in the standard mathematical treatises on category theory.},

    abstract = {Definitions of many mathematical structures used in computer science are parametrized by finite sets. To work with such structures in proof assistants, we need to be able to explain what a finite set is. In constructive mathematics, a widely used definition is listability: a set is considered to be finite, if its elements can be listed completely. In this paper, we formalize different variations of this definition in the Agda programming language. We develop a toolbox for boilerplate-free programming with finite sets that arise as subsets of some base set with decidable equality. Among other things we implement combinators for defining functions from finite sets and a prover for quantified formulas over decidable properties on finite sets.},

The base language of the Semantic Web is {RDF} [Manola and Miller, 2004], a simple representation language based on a graph structure. The Semantic Web provides a common framework that allows data to be shared and reused across application, enterprise, and community boundaries.

@article{Plotkin1977LCF,
    abstract = {The paper studies connections between denotational and operational semantics for a simple programming language based on {LCF}. It begins with the connection between the behaviour of a program and its denotation. It turns out that a program denotes ⊥ in any of several possible semantics if it does not terminate. From this it follows that if two terms have the same denotation in one of these semantics, they have the same behaviour in all contexts. The converse fails for all the semantics. If, however, the language is extended to allow certain parallel facilities behavioural equivalence does coincide with denotational equivalence in one of the semantics considered, which may therefore be called  ” fully abstract”. Next a connection is given which actually determines the semantics up to isomorphism from the behaviour alone. Conversely, by allowing further parallel facilities, every r.e. element of the fully abstract semantics becomes definable, thus characterising the programming language, up to interdefinability, from the set of r.e. elements of the domains of the semantics.},

@article{Cockx2014Pattern,
    abstract = {Dependent pattern matching is an intuitive way to write programs and proofs in dependently typed languages. It is reminiscent of both pattern matching in functional languages and case analysis in on-paper mathematics. However, in general it is incompatible with new type theories such as homotopy type theory ({HoTT}). As a consequence, proofs in such theories are typically harder to write and to understand. The source of this incompatibility is the reliance of dependent pattern matching on the so-called K axiom - also known as the uniqueness of identity proofs - which is inadmissible in {HoTT}. The Agda language supports an experimental criterion to detect definitions by pattern matching that make use of the K axiom, but so far it lacked a formal correctness proof. In this paper, we propose a new criterion for dependent pattern matching without K, and prove it correct by a translation to eliminators in the style of Goguen et al. (2006). Our criterion both allows more good definitions than existing proposals, and solves a previously undetected problem in the criterion offered by Agda. It has been implemented in Agda and is the first to be supported by a formal proof. Thus it brings the benefits of dependent pattern matching to contexts where we cannot assume K, such as {HoTT}. It also points the way to new forms of dependent pattern matching, for example on higher inductive types.},

@article{Tai2015Resourceconstrained,
    abstract = {To increase the interoperability and accessibility of data in sensor-rich systems, there has been a recent proliferation of the use of Semantic Web technologies in sensor-rich systems. Quite a range of such applications have emerged, such as hazard monitoring and rescue, context-aware computing, environmental monitoring, field studies, internet of things, and so on. These systems often assume a centralized paradigm for data processing, which does not always hold in reality especially when the systems are deployed in a hostile environment. At runtime, the infrastructure of systems deployed in such an environment is also prone to interference or damage, causing part of the infrastructure to have limited network connection or even to be detached from the rest. A solution to such a problem would be to push the intelligence, such as semantic reasoning, down to the device layer. A key enabler for such a solution is to run semantic reasoning on resource-constrained devices. This paper shows how reasoner composition (i.e. to automatically adjust a reasoning approach to preserve only a  ” well-suited” amount of reasoning for a given ontology) can achieve resource-efficient semantic reasoning. Two novel reasoner composition algorithms are introduced and implemented. Evaluation indicates that the reasoner composition algorithms greatly reduce the resources required for {OWL} reasoning, potentially facilitating greater semantic reasoning on sensor devices.},

The framework's performance is evaluated using data quality measures that have been developed to measure existing published datasets. An analysis of the framework against these dimensions demonstrates that it addresses a broad range of real-world data quality concerns.

@misc{Motik2008Structured,
    abstract = {Applications of semantic technologies often require the representation of and reasoning with structured objects—that is, objects composed of parts connected in complex ways. Although {OWL} is a general and powerful language, its class descriptions and axioms cannot be used to describe arbitrarily connected structures. {OWL} representation of structured objects can thus be underconstrained, which reduces the inferences that can be drawn and causes performance problems in reasoning. To address these problems, we extend {OWL} with description graphs, which provide for the description of structured objects in a simple and precise way. To represent conditional aspects of the domain, we also allow for {SWRL}-like rules over description graphs. Based on a novel observation about the nature of structured objects, we ensure decidability of our formalism. We also present a hypertableau-based decision procedure, which we implemented in the {HermiT} reasoner. To evaluate its performance, we extracted description graphs from the {GALEN} and {FMA} ontologies, classified them successfully, and even detected a modeling error in {GALEN}.},

The reasoner implements a tableaux decision procedure for the well known {SHOIQ} description logic, with additional support for datatypes, including strings and integers. The system employs a wide range of performance enhancing optimisations, including both standard techniques (such as absorption and model merging) and newly developed ones (such as ordering heuristics and taxonomic classification). {FaCT}++ can, via the standard {DIG} interface, be used to provide reasoning services for ontology engineering tools supporting the {OWL} {DL} ontology language. 1},

    abstract = {A transaction is a transformation of state which has the properties of atomicity (all or nothing), durability (effects survive failures) and consistency (a correct transformation). The transaction concept is key to the structuring of data management applications. The concept seems to have applicability to programming systems in general. This paper restates the transaction concepts and attempts to put several implementation approaches in perspective. It then describes some areas which require further study: (1) the integration of the transaction concept with the notion of abstract data type, (2) some techniques to allow transactions to be composed of sub-transactions, and (3) handling transactions which last for extremely long times (days or months).},

The semantic web is anticipated to provide solutions through new formats for knowledge representation and management. Software libraries for semantic web formats are becoming mature, but there exist multiple tools based on foundationally different technologies. {SWI}-Prolog, a tool with semantic web support, was integrated into the Bioclipse bio- and cheminformatics workbench software and evaluated in terms of performance against non Prolog-based semantic web tools in Bioclipse, Jena and Pellet, for querying a data set consisting of mostly numerical, {NMR} shift values, in the semantic web format {RDF}. The integration has given access to the convenience of the Prolog language for working with semantic data and defining data management workflows in Bioclipse. The performance comparison shows that {SWI}-Prolog is superior in terms of performance over Jena and Pellet for this specific dataset and suggests Prolog-based tools as interesting for further evaluations.},

@inproceedings{Ireland2009Classification,
    abstract = {Object and relational technologies are grounded in different paradigms. Each technology mandates that those who use it take a particular view of a universe of discourse. Incompatibilities between these views manifest as problems of an object-relational impedance mismatch. In this paper we propose a conceptual framework for the problem space of object-relational impedance mismatch and consequently distinguish four kinds of impedance mismatch. We show that each kind of impedance mismatch needs to be addressed using a different object-relational mapping strategy. Our framework provides a mechanism to explore issues of fidelity, integrity and completeness in the design and implementation of existing and new strategy choices. Our framework will be of benefit to standards bodies, tool vendors, designers and programmers as it will provide them with new insights into how to address problems of an object-relational impedance mismatch both at the most appropriate levels of abstraction and in the most appropriate way.},

enterprise, but increasingly a community project. The core system has been
shaped to its current form while being used as a tool for building research
prototypes, primarily for \textit{knowledge-intensive} and \textit{interactive}
systems. Community contributions have added several interfaces and the
constraint (CLP) libraries. Commercial involvement has created the initial
garbage collector, added several interfaces and two development tools: PlDoc (a
literate programming documentation system) and PlUnit (a unit testing
environment).


In this article we present SWI-Prolog as an integrating tool, supporting a
wide range of ideas developed in the Prolog community and acting as glue
between \textit{foreign} resources. This article itself is the glue between
technical articles on SWI-Prolog, providing context and experience in applying
them over a longer period.},

    abstract = {Semantic Web applications share a large portion of development effort with database-driven Web applications. Existing approaches for development of these database-driven applications cannot be directly applied to Semantic Web data due to differences in the underlying data model. We develop a mapping approach that embeds Semantic Web data into object-oriented languages and thereby enables reuse of existing Web application frameworks.

We analyse the relation between the Semantic Web and the Web, and survey the typical data access patterns in Semantic Web applications. We discuss the mismatch between object-oriented programming languages and Semantic Web data, for example in the semantics of class membership, inheritance relations, and object conformance to schemas.

We present {ActiveRDF}, an object-oriented {API} for managing {RDF} data that offers full manipulation and querying of {RDF} data, does not rely on a schema and fully conforms to {RDF}(S) semantics. {ActiveRDF} can be used with different {RDF} data stores: adapters have been implemented to generic {SPARQL} endpoints, Sesame, Jena, Redland and {YARS} and new adapters can be added easily. We demonstrate the usage of {ActiveRDF} and its integration with the popular Ruby on Rails framework which enables rapid development of Semantic Web applications.},
